# CE802_MachineLearningAndDataMining

It is a repository created for the class in University of Essex named "Machine Learning and Data Mining".
I used classification and regression for two different situations. In the classification part, I have predicted with
different algorithms to determine if the customer is eligable for travel insurance. In regression part, I tried to predict future 
price of the insurance.
